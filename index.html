						One of the most distinguished aspects of storytelling is the dialogue between the speaker and the listeners. These two develop a connection with one another through their mutual experience of the story. While the speaker reveals themselves through their story the listener reveals themselves through their understanding and perception of the story.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Social media platforms are laying out different ways for sharing information, emotions, ideas and day to day events. They are not only providing users space to share their story, but also providing room for comments, questions and conversations regardless of the time or location. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						With the constant increase of technological development in communication it is important to understand how the shift from face-to-face interactions as a predominant mean of communication to computer-mediated interactions would affect society.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Communication media has changed the interaction between the speaker and the listener. It is shaping the story within media itself and it is continuously transforming social practices.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The question which arises here and that intrigues me the most is how the mediation of social experiences influenced social norms and roles, especially the media's effects on concepts such as social reality, socialization and social change?

						To better understand what storytelling is, and how it developed into its contemporary form we must go as far back as the beginning of human history. It is considered that storytelling originated long before language. While in the beginning stories were narrated visually, one of the earliest pieces of evidence of storytelling are the cave drawings in Chauvet, France, which date as far back as

					<br>

						Stories later shifted into oral traditions and were passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. These traditions could take many forms such as epic poems, chants, rhymes, songs and more. In the book "21st century anthropology: a reference handbook" academic Katie Elson Anderson defines storytelling as

						<br>For the pre-literate societies, visual and oral traditions were the only way to pass on important cultural and historical information and it’s one of the main factors for such an ancient records to be preserved up to this day.

						Stories marked the beginning and transfer of knowledge one could boldly claim, they were our first teachers, they taught us how to make sense of the world and they brought us together in order to create our first communities.  
						Storytelling has always been a social activity in its nature. Stories have been a part of humanity since people were able to communicate and respond to the basic urge to explain, educate and enlighten. Stories bring communities together with a shared emotional event and helps them to relate to each other

						One of the most distinguished aspects of storytelling is the intimacy between the speaker and the listeners. They are seated together, often physically close. They develop a connection to one another.

						Storytelling is not purely about speaking and listening, but also about acting, seeing and imagining. There is an interactive and performative side to storytelling, which is contributing to the storyline in some way or another. The non-verbal communication such as the amount of eye contact between the speaker and the listener, the use of gestures, the facial expressions as well as the tone of the voice will be adjusted depending on the reaction of the audience.

						Stories in the past were not as formal as today. Due to the development of languages as well as the advancing informational technologies, such as the printing press, the camera, the tv, the internet and its social media platforms, stories have transformed drastically into delicately polished units of information.

They are laying out different ways for sharing information, emotions, ideas and day to day events. With the constant increase of technological development in basic communication it is important to understand how the shift from face-to-face interactions as a main mean of communication to computer-mediated interactions would affect the dialogue between the speaker and the listener.
