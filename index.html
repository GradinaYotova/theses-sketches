						One of the most distinguished aspects of storytelling is the dialogue between the speaker and the listeners. These two develop a connection with one another through their mutual experience of the story. While the speaker reveals themselves through their story the listener reveals themselves through their understanding and perception of the story.
					</p>
					<p>
						Social media platforms are laying out different ways for sharing information, emotions, ideas and day to day events. They are not only providing users space to share their story, but also providing room for comments, questions and conversations regardless of the time or location. 
					</p>
					<p>
						With the constant increase of technological development in communication it is important to understand how the shift from face-to-face interactions as a predominant mean of communication to computer-mediated interactions would affect society.
					</p>
					<p>
						Communication media has changed the interaction between the speaker and the listener. It is shaping the story within media itself and it is continuously transforming social practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						The question which arises here and that intrigues me the most is how the mediation of social experiences influenced social norms and roles. Especially the media's effects on concepts such as social reality, socialization and social change?
